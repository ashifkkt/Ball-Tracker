### Ball Tracker Animation

This project showcases a dynamic ball animation implemented using JavaScript and DOM manipulation. The animation allows users to control the movement of a ball through various buttons that manipulate its speed, direction, and play state.

#### Features:

- **Play Animation**: Start or resume the ball's rotation.
- **Pause Animation**: Pause the ball's rotation.
- **Reverse Animation**: Reverse the direction of the ball's rotation.
- **Speed Up Animation**: Increase the speed of the ball's rotation.
- **Slow Down Animation**: Decrease the speed of the ball's rotation.

#### How It Works:

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - A simple HTML layout with a `div` element representing the ball.
   - Control buttons for playing, pausing, reversing, speeding up, and slowing down the animation.

2. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - The ball animation is defined using the `animate` method, with keyframes for rotation and color change.
   - Event listeners are attached to the control buttons to manipulate the animation playback.

3. **Keyframes and Options**:
   - The `rollAnimation` array defines the keyframes for the ball's rotation and color change.
   - The `rollOptions` object sets the animation duration and iterations.



#### Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
